[First Proyect: 1998-2021 Esports Analysis](https://github.com/ByCarlox/Esport-Analysis-1998-2021)

This is a proyect I made because I'm very curios about the Esports world and videogames in general.

To make this proyects I use Bigquery to summarize the data and prepared it to used directly in Tableu, I export the csv files from the querys I wrote.

The insights we can get from this datasets are:
1. The game with the highest earnings of all times is Dota 2
2. Counter Strike Global Offensive is the game with more competitive playes
3. The genre with the highest recaudation in all time is the MOBA
4. 2020 was the year with the highest earnings
